üêáüå≥ Rabbit Sequoia: Exploring Interoperability with C#, Java, and RabbitMQ


A personal exploration into the seamless communication between C#, Java, and RabbitMQ.

Rabbit Sequoia is a learning project focused on demonstrating and understanding how applications built with different technologies (C# and Java) can effectively communicate using RabbitMQ as a message broker. It serves as a practical exercise in asynchronous communication and message queues.

‚ú® Key Features
Cross-Language Communication: Demonstrates message exchange between C# and Java applications.
RabbitMQ Integration: Leverages RabbitMQ for robust and reliable message queuing.
Practical Learning: A hands-on approach to understanding inter-process communication.
Clear and Concise Examples: Designed for easy understanding and experimentation.
üöÄ Getting Started
Get ready to explore the world of cross-platform communication!

Prerequisites
RabbitMQ: Ensure you have a running RabbitMQ server. You can install it locally or use a cloud-based service.
.NET SDK: Required for building and running the C# application.
Java Development Kit (JDK): Required for building and running the Java application.
Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone [https://github.com/iggySeawolf/rabbit-sequoia.git](https://github.com/iggySeawolf/rabbit-sequoia.git)
cd rabbit-sequoia
Set up RabbitMQ (if you haven't already):

Follow the official RabbitMQ documentation for installation instructions: https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html
Make sure the RabbitMQ server is running.
Build the C# application:

Navigate to the C# project directory.
Use the .NET CLI to build:
Bash

dotnet build
Build the Java application:

Navigate to the Java project directory.
Use your preferred build tool (e.g., Maven or Gradle) to build. For example, with Maven:
Bash

mvn clean install
or with Gradle:
Bash

./gradlew build
Basic Usage
Run the RabbitMQ server.

Run the C# application:

Navigate to the C# project's output directory (e.g., bin/Debug/net8.0).
Execute the application:
Bash

dotnet run
Run the Java application:

Navigate to the Java project's output directory (e.g., target for Maven, build/libs for Gradle).
Execute the application using the appropriate command:
Bash

# Example for Maven (adjust the JAR name if needed):
java -jar target/*.jar
Bash

# Example for Gradle (adjust the JAR name if needed):
java -jar build/libs/*.jar
Observe the interaction: Watch as the C# application sends a message to a RabbitMQ queue, and the Java application consumes and processes it.

üõ†Ô∏è Exploring Further
Here are some ideas for further exploration with this project:

Different Message Patterns: Experiment with different RabbitMQ exchange types (direct, fanout, topic, headers) and routing keys.
Message Serialization: Investigate different ways to serialize and deserialize messages (e.g., JSON).
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms for message sending and receiving.
Scaling: Consider how you might scale these applications and RabbitMQ for higher throughput.
